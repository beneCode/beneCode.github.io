        <p style="text-align: left;">
            In the beginning there were only great endless islands separated by an abyss. During the time of the great unification, the lands began to merge into one. After 1000 years, the islands united with the accompanying great eruptions. A great and majestic Atoll has emerged from the material produced during the explosion. He became the lord of this world that he named Atolhir. Its power allowed it to be transformed into strength that unites the land. After 5,000 years, when Atoll began to age and knew that he could no longer look after the world, he created life. He created Islet, who was to take over his role, and Chiromantes, who took care of the 4 realms. However, Islet rebelled. He killed Atoll and imprisoned Chiromantes. By this act, the lands began to separate again. At this point, a mysterious figure appears who decides to save the land. Will it succeed ?!
