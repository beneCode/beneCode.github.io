    <b style="font-size: 20px;">Dear mr Lund,</b> <br>

    My name is Beniamin Ociepka and I’m writing on behalf of my school. I am writing to invite you to our school for the national sports day. We would appreciate if you could deliver a speech during our opening ceremony. The aim of the event is to  inspire our students to be more active and take more interest in sports.
    <br>
    <br>
    We would also want to sincerely congratulate you on your achievements and winning of the Olympic Games gold medal. Its difficult  to describe how proud the school is of what you achieved and accomplished. We are honored that you got to study in our campus.
    <br>
    <br>
    Should you be willing to help us we could raise the awareness of the importance of sports activities and healthy lifestyle. Maybe even some of our students would be willing to follow in your steps and become sportsmans themselves.
    <br>
    <br>
    In this venture we would have a great number of various sports activities competitions. We would welcome you as a judge. It would be great if you would chose one of our students to win our school sports cup, and also if you would be able to give some other students some various tips about sports along the way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Should you be willing to visit us as our special quest, please email us back.
    <br>
    <br>
    Yours faithfully
    <br>
    <br>
    Beniamin Ociepka
