    <b style="font-size: 40px;">Stereotypes, truth or fiction?</b> <br>

    Stereotypes are a part of our everyday life. We hear stereotypes every day and everywhere. Sometimes we can find ourselves in a situation
    where we make stereotypes ourselves for other people. Every person, man or woman, is labelled with either positive or negative 
    stereotypes. Stereotyping is a way that people group each other. Each group is called by name, that does not really fit to everyone in 
    that specific group.  Stereotypes affect people’s social lives, emotions, and how people interact with their environment.

    Stereotypes have an enormous impact of how we feel. That makes people have no motivation therefore they won’t have good performance at any
    level in their life.   For instance if a black male is stereotyped as criminal and thief, how can these words encourage him to be 
    productive, so that he can move on to the next level?  This can create psychological pressure.

    Other people face stereotypes as a threat. For example there is a stereotype that says that women are bad drivers. It puts even more 
    pressure on how they feel, not only being around people who are labelling them, but being around people that they trust. They will try to 
    prove to them that this is just a stereotype and it does not exist. In addition, this occurs in situations where people worry for their 
    performance and how they look like. Besides that people don’t want their poor performance to lead to new negative stereotypes.

    Instead of focusing on stereotypes of each person, we should start paying more attention of how unique each one of us is. Stereotype 
    causes people to feel lonely and even sometimes depressed.  It’s also harmful for their environment and their social life. We should keep 
    stereotypes out of the picture, even though sometimes we can be victims ourselves. Stop judging people before you even get to know them!
