Whether you're on the fence about studying abroad or you're trying to convince your parents to foot the bill, it's important to understand the concrete benefits of living and studying in a foreign country. Whichever study abroad program you choose, it will likely improve your life in a myriad of ways outside the classroom you probably haven't even thought about.

    You'll Get to Travel the Globe. This is the most obvious benefit of studying abroad. Living in a foreign country while you're in college gives you access to travel and exploration like never before. Many programs have excursions and field trips built into them. If yours doesn't, you're likely surrounded by other study abroad students eager to see the world, so you have travel buddies built in from day one.
